I would describe myself as being a very perceptive and like-minded person who sees
and interprets the world in a very analytical way. 
I decided to study at the UOA because it provided me with the perfect opportunities to succeed in a career
path that I am passionate about. I also wanted to experience uni life in a huge city far from my own.
